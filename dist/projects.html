                    Tracking your spending is often the first step in getting your finances in order. By understanding what you spend money on and how much you spend, you can see exactly where your cash is going and areas where you can cut back.Itâ€™s easy to make this part of your everyday routine thanks to expense tracker apps that help you manage your money on the go. <br><br>
                    The first expense tracking apps came out decades ago in the form of desktop programs such as Quicken and Microsoft Money, but the world of expense tracking has come a long way since the first version of Quicken came to the market in 1983. Now you have Web and phone-based expense tracker apps that can help you reach a whole new level of financial knowledge and preparedness. If you need to track a budget, one of these expense tracker apps is likely a great fit for you.
